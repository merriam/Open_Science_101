# Open Science Resources

## Introductory Materials

The best introductory reading materials are the Wikipedia pages for [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
and [Open Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).  You may also want to watch Michael Neilson's
[TedX Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/michael_nielsen_open_science_now) from 2011.  There is also a summary blog post by Jenny Molloy named [Open Training for Open Science](http://science.okfn.org/2014/12/21/open-training-for-open-science/)
from late 2014.  The twitter feed [@openscience](https://twitter.com/openscience) post snippets of current news.

A continuing discussion of available resources on
[Quora](https://openscience.uni-bielefeld.de/898/which-materials-exist-introducing-specific-audiences-science) may have some additional links.
